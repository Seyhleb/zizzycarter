This is the best I could do, its not so aesthetic in appearance like what you actually sent. I was not going to share it till it was exactly like what you
sent but I couldn't just move forward you see. So please, tell me how I could have written it and where I absolutely messed up.

These are the challenges I faced,
please go through them and tell me what I should have done instead;

1	The Museo Slab font wouldn't render, I tried everything I could but it just wouldn't so I used "roboto".

2	I added the illustrations as single pictures, could that be the reason the blurred out when I used it?

## What I learnt##
Permit me to say that this is the first html/css code I ever wrote (besides codecademy practice) so even what seemed like the simplest things was challenging.

I never really know what margins could do before this, fascinating. 

Please go through it, I really appreciate your effort. Thanks a lot, expecting a feedback from you.
